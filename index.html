						The Sword is a quest game with 2D graphics in a fantasy-like world including hand-to-hand combat, four-way movement, item retrieval and randomly Randomly generated landscapes based on predefined environmental objects and ending with a final opponent fight. The game is based on an adventure in which the player has to build up an equipment through different types of randomly generated terrain that may contain difficulties such as monsters. The player, guided by a character in the game, equips himself as he goes along and learns the mechanics of combat to prepare for the final confrontation.
